## Project Description

This project was inspired by the [How to Apply Unsupervised Anomaly Detection on Bank Transactions](https://www.justintodata.com/unsupervised-anomaly-detection-on-bank-transactions-outliers/) article from authors of https://www.justintodata.com as the inspiration for this project.

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and fraud analytics require consideration of several factors when building production based detection systems.

For one, there is the consideration of the **limitations of the financial institution**. For example, how up to date are the systems of the institution as it is important to understand will new technology be needed to handle all of the possible feature information that machine learning (ML) models can capture. At the same time, can the current systems handle real-time decision making?

**Balancing customer experiences with bank losses**. Like medical doctors, ML detection applications should do no harm. Alerts generated from ML models should limit the impact to legit customers. At best, inconveniences should inspire a sense of confidence that the institution is looking out for the well-being of its customers. It is standard that banks and financial institutions will have to take on some losses, but tools should help identify the limits between customer annoyance and mitigating business losses.

Lastly, **understand the operation teams capacity**. While, the ML system can send anomalous transactions to agents for follow-up for further investigation and support. A priortization scheme may need to be implemented first to optimize mitigating large accounts and larger losses first. An unfortunate consequence is that small, infrequent cases may not get investigated because they do not meet largeness thresholds.

### This Project's Problem Objective

This project looks at detecting bank fraud by identifying outliers or anomalies from unlabeled bank transactions. Unlabeled refers to the fact that data does not possess any prior sort of pre-existing markers that a transaction is fraudulent or not. It focuses on creating a ML model to identify the anomolous events (i.e., labeling transactions as anomalous/fradulent or not), which would then be sent to operation and support teams for futher investigation. It presents a method for anomaly detection using `Isolation Forests`.

#### Why Isolation Forest?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_forest):

The Isolation Forest algorithm takes advantage of the attributes of anomalies being ‚Äúfew and different‚Äù. They are easier to ‚Äúisolate‚Äù compared to normal points. So instead of trying to build a model of normal instances, it explicitly isolates anomalous points in the dataset.

The main advantage of this approach is the possibility of exploiting sampling techniques to an extent that is not allowed to the profile-based methods, creating a very fast algorithm with low memory demand.

Isolation Forest is an efficient and simple algorithm used for anomaly detection which makes it a popular choice in industries like cybersecurity, finance and healthcare. It identifies outliers in large datasets by isolating them through binary partitioning which requires minimal computational overhead. This ability to quickly find anomalies is important in applications where detecting unusual patterns is key to safeguarding against risks or identifying hidden insights.

Key concepts of the Isolation Forest:

- `Isolation:` The algorithm isolates anomalies by focusing on their differences from normal data points rather than their similarities. Anomalies are typically rare and distinct from the majority which helps in making them easier to isolate.

- `Partitioning:` Data is split by randomly selecting features and using random values to partition the data. This splitting helps in efficiently isolating anomalies from normal data.

- `Anomaly Score:` It measures how easily a data point can be isolated. Points that require fewer splits to isolate are considered anomalies and assigned higher scores.

### What this Project Does Specifically

The project:

- Loads and inspects the bank data
- Preprocesses/cleans the data
- Clusters the data using an unsupervised learning algorithm: [Isolation Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_forest)
- Identifies anomalies and outliers
- Visualizes results using Seaborn

### The Project Results

The Isolation Forest model reveals bank transaction anomalies from normal transactions as shown in the figure below.

Once anomalous transactions are identified, in a production environment, they would be subsequently be examined by support and bank operation teams prior to consultation with bank customers.

The project shows how the ML detection mechanism would be a starting point for mitigating and eventually preventing bank fraud based on unsupervised data.
